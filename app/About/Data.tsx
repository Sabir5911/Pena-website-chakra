     This curriculum is intended for beginners who want to learn software development from the ground up
     . The first three quarters are shared by all specialties and are dedicated to studying Object-Oriented
      Programming and cutting-edge Full-Stack Web 2.0 development. It is going to be a fifteen-month-long hybrid 
      program that includes both onsite and online classes and is divided into five quarters of 13 weeks each. The
       emphasis will be on hands-on learning by educating students to produce projects. To accommodate everyone, courses
        will be held primarily on weekends or after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays. It employs a hybrid teaching format, 
     with core onsite classes complemented by online Zoom laboratories and recorded videos.

     In this brand-new type of curriculum, students will learn how to make money and boost
   exports in the classroom and will begin doing so within six months of the program's beginning.
   It resembles a cross between a corporate venture and an educational project.

    The graduates of this program will own products (Full-Stack App Templates, AR and VR Experiences, and APIs) that are marketed
     globally by the Panaverse DAO and, if they like, will also be able to start off by offering services at a rate of $50 per hour 
     ($96,000 per year). This would give Pakistani professionals and students a fantastic opportunity to
     better their financial situation while also giving the economy a much-needed boost by expanding software exports.
